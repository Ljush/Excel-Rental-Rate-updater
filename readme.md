- My first attempt at webscraping and excel sheet automation. Parsing string data and the like from over 50+ websites.
- I no longer work for this company and keeping up with the weird mistakes that the excel sheet kept adding and removing every month was a task no longer worth my time.
- The primary thing I learned while working on this project was to think ahead about what I was coding and to improve on implementing code protection. Several tiny modifications to any specific website could cause the respective script to crash so I just handled these crashes by stopping the program and continuing to the next website. Smarter and more efficient string parsing would improve this entire project massively.
